# Cafe-Quiet
Final project for HCDE 438 - coffee shop crowdedness and activity tracker

## Project Description
Welcome to Café Quiet, a Coffee Shop Occupancy Tracker! This application seeks to provide users who frequently use cafes as study spots to see how crowded a coffee shop currently is. In return, the user will gain insights into whether they can productively work in the space depending on the crowd levels. 

Café Quiet will first identify the user’s location and then search for nearby coffee shops. If the user does not want to provide the application with their location, they can instead search by zipcode. The application will then identify the least crowded coffee shops and display the noise level of that shop as well so that the user can make their own judgement on which café would best suit their current needs. 

### **Key Features:**
- A map that populates cafés near the user’s location
- Café ratings and connection to view reviews
- Updated crowd levels
